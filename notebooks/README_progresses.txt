Our project consists in comparing creams according to the ingredients they contain.

In the first week, we started by creating our own data base. It currently contains four creams, and our aim is to add a total of ten. In our data base, the characteristics of the different molecules in each cream were recorded.

In the second week, the database was expanded as we include the molecules of three other creams. We also started coding with the data base we had. In fact, we filtered the creams in several ways (for example, those containing sodium hydroxide or other irritants in their chemical formula were identified). So we can start testing a few scripts. However, we're waiting for the entire data base to be completed before we can start on the RDkit. Finally, we've created the Python package.
