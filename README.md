# Project of Practical Programming in Chemistry

## Description
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the use of custom functions to filter and remove items from a database. It uses Pandas to load data from a CSV file and applies several filtering functions to prepare the data for further analysis.

## Prerequisites
To run this notebook, make sure you have installed Python and the following packages:
- Pandas
- rdkit
- Chem (imported from rdkit)
- PandasTools (imported from rdkit)


You can install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas

conda create -c conda-forge -n my-rdkit-env rdkit
(do not forget to activate environnement using :conda activate my-rdkit-env)
```

## Installation:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/victoirelang/Project.git
cd Project
pip install -e .
```

## [Functions Folder:](https://github.com/victoirelang/Project/tree/main/functions)
here explain what:
1)filtering.ipnyb does (add as a precision that filtering.py exists because it is easier to use for running, in our scripts)
2)newdatabase.ipnyb
3)ranking_for_pregnancy: this file was used to stock all the functions concerning the ranking of the database on the pregnancy argument

precise at the end that for all of these functions, more details can be found in a seperate README file in the "function module"
